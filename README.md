# AgroChain (POC) 🌾

AgroChain is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** decentralized agriculture platform built on **Algorand** using **AlgoKit**.  
This project demonstrates how blockchain can empower farmers, connect them directly with buyers, reduce food inflation, and ensure full transparency in the food supply chain.  

Currently, this is a **basic starter project** with a small smart contract (from AlgoKit template) modified to showcase direct farmer–buyer interactions. The goal is to validate the concept and demonstrate integration with Algorand before scaling further.

## 🚀 What this POC Does  

- Shows how a farmer can list crops on-chain.  
- Allows a buyer to purchase directly from the farmer.  
- Demonstrates **instant payments** and **basic traceability** powered by Algorand smart contracts.  
- Uses AlgoKit’s default project setup (Python backend + React frontend) with minor changes to the sample contract.  

This is **not yet a production-ready app** — it’s a POC to prove feasibility and integration with Algorand.
